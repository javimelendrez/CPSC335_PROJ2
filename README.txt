# INTRO
This project is to write an Html+Javascript program to find a path from the mouth of this bizarre cave to one of the innermost cave rooms. The category of Bizarre Caves each has room-to-room directed links (edges) that obey three bizarre principles. Fortunately, you carry a BCS app that can tell you the available links/ways to move from your current cave room into another room. You begin at the cave mouth which has coordinates (16,0,0). You are attempting to find a route to the cave room (8,1,7),the deepest room in this cave system.
